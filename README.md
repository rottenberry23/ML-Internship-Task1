# Student Exam Score Prediction  
**Task 1 - Machine Learning Internship at Elevvo Pathways**

This repository contains a regression analysis project aimed at predicting students' exam scores based on various input features such as study hours, sleep, participation, and more. This project was completed as Task 1 of the Machine Learning Internship at Elevvo Pathways.

---

## Objectives

- Build a Linear Regression model to predict exam scores using study hours  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and basic data cleaning  
- Implement Polynomial Regression for improved accuracy  
- Experiment with additional features to build multivariable models  
- Evaluate model performance using metrics such as MAE, MSE, and RÂ²

---

## Tools and Libraries

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  
- Google Colab

---

## Models Implemented

1. Linear Regression (study hours vs. exam scores)  
2. Polynomial Regression (study hours vs. exam scores)  
3. Multivariable Linear Regression (with added features such as sleep and participation)  
4. Polynomial Regression with multiple features

---

## Visualizations

- Study hours vs. exam scores (with linear and polynomial fits)  
- Actual vs. predicted score plots  
- Feature correlation heatmaps  
- Model performance comparison charts

---

## Dataset

- Student Performance Factors dataset from Kaggle  
(Link to the dataset can be added here)
